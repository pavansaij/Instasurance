         </h1>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="pandatip" style="display: none;">PandaTip: Sales quotes are usually for items/goods – i.e. tangible things that will be delivered to a customer.
           This template provides a sample layout, showing the types of information a sales quote may include.</p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">[COMPANY NAME]
           <span style="color: #ffffff;">. &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="pandatip" style="display: none;">PandaTip: Like other quotes, you will want some kind of expiration date for your sales quote. Without it, it may
           give the impression that the prices stand forever – or at least for longer than you may like. An expiration date
           also accomplishes something else; i.e., it puts some pressure on the customer to issue a purchase order or sign
           a contract for the items. After all, they don’t want the price to go up!</p>

         <p class="pandatip">PandaTip: While quotes typically don’t contain as much information as proposals, they should contain more than
           just pricing information. Some examples of other information provided in quotations is below.</p>
         <p>This quotation is subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Delivery will be made within [DAYS] days following [COMPANY NAME] receipt of payment.</li>
           <li>Delivery will be made f.o.b. [COMPANY NAME] facility.</li>
           <li>The general terms and conditions of purchase at [WEBSITE LINK OR REFERENCE TO ATTACHMENT] apply to this quotation
             contract.</li>
           <li>This quotation may be accepted to form a binding contract upon any one of the following options:
             <ul>
               <li>Signature below and payment to [COMPANY NAME] for the items listed in this quote prior to the expiration
                 date..</li>
               <li>Issuance of a purchase order to [COMPANY NAME] referencing this quote and the terms and conditions herein
                 prior to the expiration date above.</li>

           </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="pandatip">PandaTip: The sample language above, together with the signature block below allows this sales quotation to also
           act as a contract when signed. This may be useful for customers that don’t typically issue purchase orders, and
           would rather sign a contract.</p>
